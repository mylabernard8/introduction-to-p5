# Reflection
### What was challenging for you during this process?
* When creating this drawing, it was hard trying to fin the exact cooridinates needed to situate all the shapes in the areas I wanted them to go. I had to use a lot of guessing and checking. It did help planning out on paper first because a lot of the cooridinates I found using math actually worked.
   
### What makes more sense now than it did before you started?
* Now, I understand how to use JavaScript to get the basic shapes needed and how each shape needs a different amount and kind of information to carry out its process. Also, I had more trouble using GitHub then P5 due to the fact I am not used to it yet and some of the files I needed to get uploaded took a few tries to actually carry out. 

### What are you proud of?
* I am actually very proud of the image I was able to produce and how I was able to get everything symmetrical and work perfectly within the P5 place.
* One thing I am confused about is how to actaully see this image within GitHub.
